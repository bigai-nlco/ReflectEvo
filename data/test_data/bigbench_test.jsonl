{"question": "using fisheye for landscapes on nikon dx? I find that for a lot of my landscape photos the 18-55mm lens is just not wide enough at 18mm. I have been looking at a Tokina 11-16, but it is pricey, so i haven't pulled the trigger on it yet. However, i came across this photo that was supposedly taken with a Opteka 6.5mm fish eye and it got me thinking ..... why couldn't i go this much cheaper route instead? What are the cons? As far as i know you must either keep the horizon in the middle, or straighten the photo in post? Straightening in post doesn't seem like a big hassle considering we always perform some type of post touch-up anyway. Am i missing some other, bigger drawbacks that should convince me to hold out and just buy the Tokina 11-16 over a fish eye?\n\nQuestion: What type of lens does the user want to try to use for landscapes?", "answer": "fisheye"}
{"question": "The neutrino is a particle emitted in beta decay that was unanticipated and is of fundamental importance. The neutrino was not even proposed in theory until more than 20 years after beta decay was known to involve electron emissions. Neutrinos are so difficult to detect that the first direct evidence of them was not obtained until 1953. Neutrinos are nearly massless, have no charge, and do not interact with nucleons via the strong nuclear force. Traveling approximately at the speed of light, they have little time to affect any nucleus they encounter. This is, owing to the fact that they have no charge (and they are not EM waves), they do not interact through the EM force. They do interact via the relatively weak and very short range weak nuclear force. Consequently, neutrinos escape almost any detector and penetrate almost any shielding. However, neutrinos do carry energy, angular momentum (they are fermions with half-integral spin), and linear momentum away from a beta decay. When accurate measurements of beta decay were made, it became apparent that energy, angular momentum, and linear momentum were not accounted for by the daughter nucleus and electron alone. Either a previously unsuspected particle was carrying them away, or three conservation laws were being violated. Wolfgang Pauli made a formal proposal for the existence of neutrinos in 1930. The Italian-born American physicist Enrico Fermi (1901–1954) gave neutrinos their name, meaning little neutral ones, when he developed a sophisticated theory of beta decay (see Figure 31.18). Part of Fermi’s theory was the identification of the weak nuclear force as being distinct from the strong nuclear force and in fact responsible for beta decay.\n\nQuestion: When?", "answer": "1930"}

{"question": "We have a house with an open floor plan, and were not yet ready to install a HEPA filter on the furnace. We bought a couple of these for smaller spaces, and a different larger purifier for the largest space. These have been great! My husband (an allergist) has recently become very allergic to the cats. By banning the cats from the bedroom (every allergist's first recommendation), and using these in the bedroom and his office, those spaces are constant \"safe\" zones. I am very pleased. I'm back online to purchase two more because I love what these do for the air circulation in our poorly ventilated house. The upstairs is chronically 5-10 degrees warmer than the main level, and our bedroom unit circulates the air such that our room in more comfortable than it has been in years. We are putting these in the kids rooms in place of their white noise machines (on the highest filtration setting, the \"white\" wind noise of these purifiers is more pleasant than the machines we use), and to improve air circulation. When I vacuum the filter, it is always filthy, but it doesn't seem to ever be overfull, the unit seems to always be effective. By having two more of these, we expect it will improve the overall air quality as well as circulation. For the price, I definitely recommend these!(BTW, for those wondering about ionizing units, the ionizing units release ozone, and the allergy community feels that even the small amount of ozone released can be more irritating to asthmatics than the allergens, and thus the latest recommendations say to avoid any purifier that releases ANY amount of ozone. My husband had us turn off our furnace air filter and remove the ionizing coils, and just replace the coils with a cardboard filter. It's hardly a perfect fix, but it is better than the ozone (we didn't realize) it was releasing before.

{"question": "(CNN) -- One of two gay men jailed in Malawi after they got engaged has been transferred to another prison, a human rights campaigner and gay rights activist said Wednesday. \n\nIt was not clear why Steven Mojenza was moved from Chichiri prison, where he had been serving time with his partner, Tiwonge Chimbalanga. The pair was sentenced last week to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of gross indecency and unnatural acts. \n\nThough in separate cells at Chichiri, the men were able to see each other briefly \"from time to time,\" said Peter Tatchell, a London-based gay rights activist who has been advocating for the men. \n\nGift Trapence, executive director of the Malawi-based human rights group Center for the Development of People, visited Chimbalanga in prison Wednesday and said Mojenza was not the only prisoner who was moved to another facility. \n\nTrapence said he planned to visit Mojenza at the new prison Thursday and would learn more then. \n\nTatchell expressed fears for Mojenza's mental and physical health. \n\nNo appeal has been scheduled, Trapence said. \n\n\"The lawyers are going to submit the papers either this week or next week,\" he told CNN from Malawi. \"The court is going to give the dates for the appeal, so we can't speculate right now because the court has not given the date.\" \n\nLawyers for the men are hopeful the 14-year sentence will either be reduced or thrown out on appeal, Trapence said. \n\nThe two men, both in their 20s, were arrested in December at their home in Blantyre, Malawi, for professing their love in a traditional engagement ceremony.

{"question": "20.3 | Terrestrial Biomes By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Identify the two major abiotic factors that determine the type of terrestrial biome in an area • Recognize distinguishing characteristics of each of the eight major terrestrial biomes Earth’s biomes can be either terrestrial or aquatic. Terrestrial biomes are based on land, while aquatic biomes include both ocean and freshwater biomes. The eight major terrestrial biomes on Earth are each distinguished by characteristic temperatures and amount of precipitation. Annual totals and fluctuations of precipitation affect the kinds of vegetation and animal life that can exist in broad geographical regions. Temperature variation on a daily and seasonal basis is also important for predicting the geographic distribution of a biome. Since a biome is defined by climate, the same biome can occur in geographically distinct areas with similar climates (Figure 20.18). There are also large areas on Antarctica, Greenland, and in mountain ranges that are covered by permanent glaciers and support very little life. Strictly speaking, these are not considered biomes and in addition to extremes of cold, they are also often deserts with very low precipitation.\n\nQuestion: Is aquatic freshwater only?", "answer": "No."}

A. Hobson (1858–1940), Joseph Schumpeter (1883–1950), Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929), and Norman Angell (1872–1967). While these non-Marxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I, they remained active in the interwar years. Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and it's impact on Europe, as well as contributed to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the United States from the 1950s.

{"question": "Lenses came into widespread use in Europe with the invention of spectacles, probably in Italy in the 1280s. This was the start of the optical industry of grinding and polishing lenses for spectacles, first in Venice and Florence in the thirteenth century, and later in the spectacle-making centres in both the Netherlands and Germany. Spectacle makers created improved types of lenses for the correction of vision based more on empirical knowledge gained from observing the effects of the lenses (probably without the knowledge of the rudimentary optical theory of the day). The practical development and experimentation with lenses led to the invention of the compound optical microscope around 1595, and the refracting telescope in 1608, both of which appeared in the spectacle-making centres in the Netherlands.\n\n\nQuestion: When did the optical industry start?", "answer": "Venice and Florence in the thirteenth century"}
{"question": "MathWorld is an online mathematics reference work, created and largely written by Eric W. Weisstein. It is sponsored by and licensed to Wolfram Research, Inc. and was partially funded by the National Science Foundation's National Science Digital Library grant to the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. \n\nEric W. Weisstein, the creator of the site, was a physics and astronomy student who got into the habit of writing notes on his mathematical readings. In 1995 he put his notes online and called it \"Eric's Treasure Trove of Mathematics.\" It contained hundreds of pages/articles, covering a wide range of mathematical topics. The site became popular as an extensive single resource on mathematics on the web. Weisstein continuously improved the notes and accepted corrections and comments from online readers. In 1998, he made a contract with CRC Press and the contents of the site were published in print and CD-ROM form, titled \"CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics.\" The free online version became only partially accessible to the public. In 1999 Weisstein went to work for Wolfram Research, Inc. (WRI), and WRI renamed the Math Treasure Trove to \"MathWorld\" and hosted it on the company's website without access restrictions. \n\nIn 2000, CRC Press sued WRI, WRI president Stephen Wolfram, and author Eric Weisstein, due to what they considered a breach of contract: that the \"MathWorld\" content was to remain in print only. The site was taken down by a court injunction. The case was later settled out of court, with WRI paying an unspecified amount and complying with other stipulations.

{"question": "The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \"emperor\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \"Augustus\" or \"Caesar\". Another title often used was \"imperator\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \"princeps\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \"Princeps senatus\", \"Consul\" and \"Pontifex Maximus\". \n\nThe legitimacy of an emperor's rule depended on his control of the army and recognition by the Senate; an emperor would normally be proclaimed by his troops, or invested with imperial titles by the Senate, or both. The first emperors reigned alone; later emperors would sometimes rule with co-Emperors and divide administration of the Empire between them. \n\nThe Romans considered the office of emperor to be distinct from that of a king. The first emperor, Augustus, resolutely refused recognition as a monarch. Although Augustus could claim that his power was authentically republican, his successor, Tiberius, could not convincingly make the same claim. Nonetheless, for the first three hundred years of Roman Emperors, from Augustus until Diocletian, a great effort was made to emphasize that the Emperors were the leaders of a Republic.\n\nQuestion: What did the Emperor need to control to asssure his rule?", "answer": "control of the army for one"}

{"question": "Cranial Nerves The nerves attached to the brain are the cranial nerves, which are primarily responsible for the sensory and motor functions of the head and neck (one of these nerves targets organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities as part of the parasympathetic nervous system). There are twelve cranial nerves, which are designated CNI through CNXII for “Cranial Nerve,” using Roman numerals for 1 through 12. They can be classified as sensory nerves, motor nerves, or a combination of both, meaning that the axons in these nerves originate out of sensory ganglia external to the cranium or motor nuclei within the brain stem. Sensory axons enter the brain to synapse in a nucleus. Motor axons connect to skeletal muscles of the head or neck. Three of the nerves are solely composed of sensory fibers; five are strictly motor; and the remaining four are mixed nerves. Learning the cranial nerves is a tradition in anatomy courses, and students have always used mnemonic devices to remember the nerve names. A traditional mnemonic is the rhyming couplet, “On Old Olympus’ Towering Tops/A Finn And German Viewed Some Hops,” in which the initial letter of each word corresponds to the initial letter in the name of each nerve. The names of the nerves have changed over the years to reflect current usage and more accurate naming.

{"question": "One answer is that issuing debt is a way to pay for useful things, and we should do more of that when the price is right. The United States suffers from obvious deficiencies in roads, rails, water systems and more; meanwhile, the federal government can borrow at historically low interest rates. So this is a very good time to be borrowing and investing in the future, and a very bad time for what has actually happened: an unprecedented decline in public construction spending adjusted for population growth and inflation. Beyond that, those very low interest rates are telling us something about what markets want. I’ve already mentioned that having at least some government debt outstanding helps the economy function better. How so? The answer, according to M.I.T.’s Ricardo Caballero and others, is that the debt of stable, reliable governments provides “safe assets” that help investors manage risks, make transactions easier and avoid a destructive scramble for cash. Now, in principle the private sector can also create safe assets, such as deposits in banks that are universally perceived as sound. In the years before the 2008 financial crisis Wall Street claimed to have invented whole new classes of safe assets by slicing and dicing cash flows from subprime mortgages and other sources. But all of that supposedly brilliant financial engineering turned out to be a con job: When the housing bubble burst, all that AAA-rated paper turned into sludge. So investors scurried back into the haven provided by the debt of the United States and a few other major economies. In the process they drove interest rates on that debt way down.\n\nQuestion: What year was was the financial crisis that included the housing bubble bursting?", "answer": "2008"}

I was thinking today about what an ideal cast for a new iteration of All Stars would be in a post-Cambodia world and I had a sad thought - this is the first time I've ever envisioned a new All Stars without Richard Hatch. I don't think he is a lock to return anymore, which is weird. Heroes and Villains - he was a lock to return if he was legally able to go.

{"question": "Ever since the Supreme Court permitted political committees to raise unlimited sums for independent spending, the super PAC has occupied a growing place in the political ecosystem. The 2012 version of presidential super PACs mainly paid for ads. Restore Our Future, the PAC supporting Mr. Romney, spent 97.6 percent of its $142 million in independent expenditures — messages advocating Mr. Romney’s election or the defeat of his opponents — on broadcast ads and mail. Priorities USA Action, which backed Mr. Obama, spent almost exclusively on TV, radio and online advertising, according to Federal Election Commission records. Together with the national parties, both sides managed to raise and spend nearly $2 billion. Some donors balked at giving large amounts of money for negative television ads, so a Democratic super PAC was created to help conduct opposition research.\n\nQuestion: What does mainly pay  the 2012 version of presidential super PACs?", "answer": "for ads"}

{"question": "On Monday, Mrs. Clinton helped cause biotechnology stocks to fall after she posted on Twitter, criticizing “price gouging” in the drug market, specifically referring to one company’s sudden decision to raise the price of a 62-year-old drug to $750 a tablet from $13.50. (She repeated the story in Iowa on Tuesday.) The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index fell more than 4 percent on Monday on fears that government action to control pharmaceutical prices could be coming. On Tuesday, the index fell more modestly but had recovered somewhat by the end of the day. Wall Street analysts said that many of the proposals were unlikely to be enacted with Republicans controlling Congress, even if Mrs. Clinton became president. “Bottom line is, politically this doesn’t happen,” Terry Haines, Washington analyst for the investment bank Evercore ISI, told clients on a webcast.\n\nQuestion: Which party controlled congress at the time of this article's release?

{"question": "Corporate America, as a whole, has long fought paid leave. Executives, especially at small businesses, say it burdens employers with additional costs and the need to temporarily replace employees. Some studies have found that when governments require paid leave, employers pay for it by decreasing employees’ wages. “I certainly think there’s a lot of people who benefit from paid leave,” said James Sherk, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group in Washington. “But given it’s not a free lunch and employees are paying for it, I’d prefer it was a decision the employee was making and not being forced on them.” Some small businesses are offering their own paid leave policies. Molly Moon’s Homemade Ice Cream, a Seattle chain, recently began offering employees 12 weeks of paid parental leave. “It was not just the right thing to do but also a really important retention policy,” said Molly Moon Neitzel, the owner. In the prelude to the 2016 election, Democrats have signaled that they see paid leave as a political winner — a broadly popular policy change that addresses economic anxiety. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate, has called for legislation to guarantee paid sick, vacation and family leave.\n\nQuestion: Who is the Vermont senator?", "answer": "Bernie Sanders"}

{"question": "In 2005, parts of the Amazon basin experienced the worst drought in one hundred years, and there were indications that 2006 could have been a second successive year of drought. A July 23, 2006 article in the UK newspaper The Independent reported Woods Hole Research Center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought. Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argue in the article that this drought response, coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate, are pushing the rainforest towards a \"tipping point\" where it would irreversibly start to die. It concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert, with catastrophic consequences for the world's climate.\n\nQuestion: Along with drought, what is one other factor that is pushing the Amazon rainforest towards a tipping point?", "answer": "deforestation"}
{"question": "The election held in 1988 saw the advent of the mlolongo (queuing) system, where voters were supposed to line up behind their favoured candidates instead of a secret ballot. This was seen as the climax of a very undemocratic regime and it led to widespread agitation for constitutional reform. Several contentious clauses, including one that allowed for only one political party were changed in the following years.

{"question": "Food Energy and ATP Animals need food to obtain energy and maintain homeostasis. Homeostasis is the ability of a system to maintain a stable internal environment even in the face of external changes to the environment. For example, the normal body temperature of humans is 37°C (98.6°F). Humans maintain this temperature even when the external temperature is hot or cold. It takes energy to maintain this body temperature, and animals obtain this energy from food. The primary source of energy for animals is carbohydrates, mainly glucose. Glucose is called the body’s fuel. The digestible carbohydrates in an animal’s diet are converted to glucose molecules through a series of catabolic chemical reactions. Adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, is the primary energy currency in cells; ATP stores energy in phosphate ester bonds. ATP releases energy when the phosphodiester bonds are broken and ATP is converted to ADP and a phosphate group. ATP is produced by the oxidative reactions in the cytoplasm and mitochondrion of the cell, where carbohydrates, proteins, and fats undergo a series of metabolic reactions collectively called cellular respiration. For example, glycolysis is a series of reactions in which glucose is converted to pyruvic acid and some of its chemical potential energy is transferred to NADH and ATP. ATP is required for all cellular functions. It is used to build the organic molecules that are required for cells and tissues; it provides energy for muscle contraction and for the transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system. When the amount of ATP is available in excess of the body’s requirements, the liver uses the excess ATP and excess glucose to produce molecules called glycogen. Glycogen is a polymeric form of glucose and is stored in the liver and skeletal muscle cells. When blood sugar drops, the liver releases glucose from stores of glycogen. Skeletal muscle converts glycogen to glucose during intense exercise. The process of converting glucose and excess ATP to glycogen and the storage of excess energy is an evolutionarily important step in helping animals deal with mobility, food shortages, and famine.\n\nQuestion: is it vital?", "answer": "yes"}
{"question": "Normandy was the site of several important developments in the history of classical music in the 11th century. Fécamp Abbey and Saint-Evroul Abbey were centres of musical production and education. At Fécamp, under two Italian abbots, William of Volpiano and John of Ravenna, the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught. It is still the most common form of pitch representation in English- and German-speaking countries today. Also at Fécamp, the staff, around which neumes were oriented, was first developed and taught in the 11th century.

{"question": "As mentioned above, a positive or converging lens in air focuses a collimated beam travelling along the lens axis to a spot (known as the focal point) at a distance f from the lens. Conversely, a point source of light placed at the focal point is converted into a collimated beam by the lens. These two cases are examples of image formation in lenses. In the former case, an object at an infinite distance (as represented by a collimated beam of waves) is focused to an image at the focal point of the lens. In the latter, an object at the focal length distance from the lens is imaged at infinity.

{"question": "In 2007, there were about 4,350 schools, about half of which were primary schools; on average, each school had 688 students. In recent years, Istanbul's educational system has expanded substantially; from 2000 to 2007, the number of classrooms and teachers nearly doubled and the number of students increased by more than 60 percent. Galatasaray High School, established in 1481 as the Galata Palace Imperial School, is the oldest high school in Istanbul and the second-oldest educational institution in the city. It was built at the behest of Sultan Bayezid II, who sought to bring students with diverse backgrounds together as a means of strengthening his growing empire. It is one of Turkey's Anatolian High Schools, elite public high schools that place a stronger emphasis on instruction in foreign languages. Galatasaray, for example, offers instruction in French; other Anatolian High Schools primarily teach in English or German alongside Turkish.

{"question": "Julianna Huth, a second grader at Green Primary School, in Green, Ohio, is a fan of the digital world. The 8-year-old enjoys e-books at home and at school. \"It's just cool that you can read on your IPad,\" said Julianna, who started using e-books when she was 6. \"It's more fun and you learn more from it.\" \n\nChildren would say that books on e-readers are fun. They include music, cartoons and other interactive functions that make reading a book feel like playing a video game. But is it better than a book? \n\nJulianna's teacher, Kourtney Denning, thinks highly of e-books. \"Traditional books aren't good enough anymore,\" she said. \"We have to transform our learning as we know it.\" \n\nJulianna's mother, Cathy Ivancic, said that electronic devices like the IPad were new and fun and gave children the motivation to read, including those who didn't like reading. \n\nSome people, however, are suggesting a closer look, especially for younger children learning to read. \"Read traditional books with your child. We don't have any evidence that any kind of electronic device is better than a parent,\" said Julia Parish-Morris, who has studied e-books and how children interact with them. \n\nMs. Parish-Morris and educators are concerned that children can be distracted by the cartoons and gamelike features within e-books. Keeping a focus on the story is important in developing reading and writing skills. \n\n\"The most important thing is sitting and talking with your children,\" said Gabrille Strouse, a professor who has studied e-books. \"Whether you're reading a book or an e-book, co-interacting, co-viewing is the best way for them to learn.\" \n\nLisa Guernsey, director of the early education initiative at the New America Foundation, says conversations about how events of a story relate to(......) the child's own life, or asking open-ended questions about what happened, are examples of natural dialogue.

{"question": "The name İstanbul (Turkish pronunciation: [isˈtanbuɫ] (listen), colloquially [ɯsˈtambuɫ]) is commonly held to derive from the Medieval Greek phrase \"εἰς τὴν Πόλιν\" (pronounced [is tim ˈbolin]), which means \"to the city\" and is how Constantinople was referred to by the local Greeks.  This reflected its status as the only major city in the vicinity. The importance of Constantinople in the Ottoman world was also reflected by its Ottoman name 'Der Saadet' meaning the 'gate to Prosperity' in Ottoman. An alternative view is that the name evolved directly from the name Constantinople, with the first and third syllables dropped. A Turkish folk etymology traces the name to Islam bol \"plenty of Islam\" because the city was called Islambol (\"plenty of Islam\") or Islambul (\"find Islam\") as the capital of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. It is first attested shortly after the conquest, and its invention was ascribed by some contemporary writers to Sultan Mehmed II himself. Some Ottoman sources of the 17th century, such as Evliya Çelebi, describe it as the common Turkish name of the time; between the late 17th and late 18th centuries, it was also in official use. The first use of the word \"Islambol\" on coinage was in 1703 (1115 AH) during the reign of Sultan Ahmed III. Nevertheless, the use of the name Constantinople remained common in English into the 20th century, Istanbul became common only after Turkey adapted the Latin alphabet in 1928 and urged other countries to use the city's Turkish name. The Vikings were sailing down the Russian rivers from the North Sea, entering the Black Sea and arriving in Constantinople around the 10th century.

{"question": "2.2 Water Water has many properties that are critical to maintaining life. It is polar, allowing for the formation of hydrogen bonds, which allow ions and other polar molecules to dissolve in water. Therefore, water is an excellent solvent. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules give water the ability to hold heat better than many other substances. As the temperature rises, the hydrogen bonds between water continually break and reform, allowing for the overall temperature to remain stable, although increased energy is added to the system. Water’s cohesive forces allow for the property of surface tension. All of these unique properties of water are important in the chemistry of living organisms. The pH of a solution is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. A solution with a high number of hydrogen ions is acidic and has a low pH value. A solution with a high number of hydroxide ions is basic and has a high pH value. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with a pH of 7 being neutral. Buffers are solutions that moderate pH changes when an acid or base is added to the buffer system. Buffers are important in biological systems because of their ability to maintain constant pH conditions.\n\nQuestion: What solution will moderate a pH change when an acid or base is added?", "answer": "Buffers"}
{"question": "The initial medical schools that granted the (Doctor of Medicine) degrees were Columbia, Penn, Harvard, Maryland, and McGill. These first few North American medical schools that were established were (for the most part) founded by physicians and surgeons who had been trained in England and Scotland. University medical education in England culminated with the MB qualification, and in Scotland the MD, until in the mid-19th century the public bodies who regulated medical practice at the time required practitioners in Scotland as well as England to hold the dual Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees (MB BS/MBChB/MB BChir/BM BCh etc.). North American medical schools switched to the tradition of the ancient universities of Scotland and began granting the MD title rather than the MB beginning in the late 18th century. The Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York (which at the time was referred to as King's College of Medicine) was the first American university to grant the MD degree instead of the MB.\n\n\nQuestion: Which tradition are North American schools following when they grant the MD title rather than the MB title?", "answer": "ancient universities of Scotland"}
{"question": "A construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations, each of which all parties must carefully consider. A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties, but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible. The time element in construction means that a delay costs money, and in cases of bottlenecks, the delay can be extremely expensive. Thus, the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out. Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly, whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse.\n\nQuestion: What leads to confusion and collapse?", "answer": "poorly drafted contracts"}

{"question": "Law enforcement agencies, from the Drug Enforcement Administration to local police departments, have struggled to control the flow of synthetic cannabinoids, substances that look like marijuana that are sprayed with a hallucinogenic chemical and then smoked. Those chemicals, typically imported from China by American distributors, come in hundreds of varieties; new formulations appear monthly, with molecules subtly tweaked to try to skirt the D.E.A.’s list of illegal drugs as well as drug-detecting urine tests. Although the entire class of drugs is illegal because of the psychological effects, each new variety can present distinct health risks caused by its underlying chemistry or contaminants in renegade manufacturing facilities. Experts warn that the popular term “synthetic marijuana” is a misnomer, as the substances merely resemble marijuana but can be 100 times as potent. The use of synthetic cannabinoids as well as calls to poison control centers had decreased from 2011 through 2014, as awareness of their danger and illegality has spread, national data indicates.\n\nQuestion: Who has struggled to control the flow of synthetic cannabinoids?", "answer": "Law enforcement agencies"}
{"question": "A. No. I think for women it wasn’t expected in my family, even though my sister ended up studying gemology. She was a diamond grader in New York and eventually worked for our gemstones division. When I did look to enter the business, the idea wasn’t rejected, but it was just not expected. Q. Why did you want to join? A. I think very innately I had a strong connection to the product and the business because I grew up in it. Every single meal conversation was about the company, and growing up as a child I was interested. But later on my first reaction was, “I’m not going to go into the business, I’m going to find my own identity, and do my own thing,” which is why I studied art history and languages and started working in the art world and then the fashion industry.\n\nQuestion: What was her sister's first job after school?", "answer": "diamond grader"}
{"question": "Chapter 8: The Siege Begins. \n\nOn the 19th of June General Eliott, accompanied by several of his officers, paid a visit to the Spanish lines to congratulate General Mendoza, who commanded there, on the promotion that he had just received. The visit lasted but a short time, and it was remarked that the Spanish officer seemed ill at ease. Scarcely had the party returned to Gibraltar than a Swedish frigate entered the bay, having on board Mr. Logie, H.M. Consul in Barbary, who had come across in her from Tangier. He reported that a Swedish brig had put in there. She reported that she had fallen in with the French fleet, of twenty-eight sail of the line, off Cape Finisterre; and that they were waiting there to be joined by the Spanish fleet, from Cadiz. \n\nThe news caused great excitement; but it was scarcely believed, for the Spanish general had given the most amicable assurances to the governor. On the 21st, however, the Spaniards, at their lines across the neutral ground, refused to permit the mail to pass; and a formal notification was sent in that intercourse between Gibraltar and Spain would no longer be permitted. This put an end to all doubt, and discussion. War must have been declared between Spain and England, or such a step would never have been taken. \n\nIn fact, although the garrison did not learn it until some time later, the Spanish ambassador in London had presented what was virtually a declaration of war, on the 16th. A messenger had been sent off on the same day from Madrid, ordering the cessation of intercourse with Gibraltar and, had he not been detained by accident on the road, he might have arrived during General Eliott's visit to the Spanish lines; a fact of which Mendoza had been doubtless forewarned, and which would account for his embarrassment at the governor's call. \n\nQuestion: Who visited him?", "answer": "General Eliott and several of his officers"}
{"question": "Tin does not occur as the native element but must be extracted from various ores. Cassiterite (SnO2) is the only commercially important source of tin, although small quantities of tin are recovered from complex sulfides such as stannite, cylindrite, franckeite, canfieldite, and teallite.

{"question": "Carbon’s affinity for covalent bonding means that many distinct and relatively stable organic molecules nevertheless readily form larger, more complex molecules. Any large molecule is referred to as macromolecule (macro- = “large”), and the organic compounds in this section all fit this description. However, some macromolecules are made up of several “copies” of single units called monomer (mono- = “one”; -mer = “part”). Like beads in a long necklace, these monomers link by covalent bonds to form long polymers (poly- = “many”). There are many examples of monomers and polymers among the organic compounds. Monomers form polymers by engaging in dehydration synthesis (see Figure 2.14). As was noted earlier, this reaction results in the release of a molecule of water. Each monomer contributes: One gives up a hydrogen atom and the other gives up a hydroxyl group. Polymers are split into monomers by hydrolysis (-lysis = “rupture”). The bonds between their monomers are broken, via the donation of a molecule of water, which contributes a hydrogen atom to one monomer and a hydroxyl group to the other.\n\nQuestion: How many \"part\"s?", "answer": "One"}

ABC's other owned-and-operated stations launched over the course of the next 13 months: WENR-TV in Chicago signed on the air on September 17, while WXYZ-TV in Detroit went on the air on October 9, 1948. In October 1948, as a result of an influx of television station license applications that it had issued as well as a study it undertook on the use of the VHF spectrum for broadcasting purposes, the FCC implemented a freeze on new station applications. However, KGO-TV in San Francisco, which had received its license prior to the freeze, made its debut on May 5, 1949. On May 7, 1949, Billboard revealed that ABC had proposed an investment of $6.25 million, of which it would spend $2.5 million to convert 20 acres (80,937 m2) of land in Hollywood into what would become The Prospect Studios, and construct a transmitter on Mount Wilson, in anticipation of the launch of KECA-TV, which was scheduled to begin operations on August 1 (but would not actually sign on until September 16).\n\nQuestion: When did the FCC freeze incoming applications for new stations?", "answer": "October 1948"}

{"question": "That may be one way of thinking about the law’s benefits for the newly insured, who had limited access to the health care system. For many, their new coverage means they can get free checkups and preventive disease screenings, and can more easily pay for big health care needs, like prescription drugs and operations. Early evidence suggests they are facing less financial stress as a result of their coverage. Some are now managing chronic and potentially life-threatening health conditions. But those benefits don’t mean we should be surprised by the actuaries’ recent findings on spending growth. More people in the health care system means more dollars spent on health care. The increase doesn’t mean that Obamacare is leading to runaway costs, or that it’s failing to reform the health care system to make it more efficient. But it does mean that we can’t think of the coverage expansion as free.\n\nQuestion: What type of screenings can the newly insured receive?", "answer": "preventive disease screenings"}

{"question": "Cardiovascular System: Arteriosclerosis Compliance allows an artery to expand when blood is pumped through it from the heart, and then to recoil after the surge has passed. This helps promote blood flow. In arteriosclerosis, compliance is reduced, and pressure and resistance within the vessel increase. This is a leading cause of hypertension and coronary heart disease, as it causes the heart to work harder to generate a pressure great enough to overcome the resistance. Arteriosclerosis begins with injury to the endothelium of an artery, which may be caused by irritation from high blood glucose, infection, tobacco use, excessive blood lipids, and other factors. Artery walls that are constantly stressed by blood flowing at high pressure are also more likely to be injured—which means that hypertension can promote arteriosclerosis, as well as result from it. Recall that tissue injury causes inflammation. As inflammation spreads into the artery wall, it weakens and scars it, leaving it stiff (sclerotic). As a result, compliance is reduced. Moreover, circulating triglycerides and cholesterol can seep between the damaged lining cells and become trapped within the artery wall, where they are frequently joined by leukocytes, calcium, and cellular debris. Eventually, this buildup, called plaque, can narrow arteries enough to impair blood flow. The term for this condition, atherosclerosis (athero- = “porridge”) describes the mealy deposits (Figure 20.14).\n\nQuestion: And what else?", "answer": "scars it"}

{"question": "**Joseph Dredd tapped to serve as new Supreme Court Justice** \n\n2/19/16 Today marks the first instance since the Reagan administration that a president has nominated a new Supreme Court Justice during the final year of his presidency. President Barack Obama made his nomination in an announcement during a press conference earlier today. The senate is expected to confirm the nomination of Joseph Dredd, citing significant pressure from Joseph Dredd. \n\nThe president's choice has been scrutinized since the death of Justice Scalia, on Feb. 13th. Democrats are hailing the nomination as a victory for the party in the face of a GOP that criticized the president's swift search for Justice Scalia's succesor. The GOP had voiced criticism of president's intentions to nominate a new justice before his term ends next year, with one GOP spokesperson commenting, ``Scalia isn't even cold yet. ''The party has been hush, with the exception of presidential candidates as they vie for consideration before this weekend's primaries. \n\nJeb Bush, who recently faced his own backlash after posting a picture of his gun on his twitter account, expressed sympathy for the president's position, but does not agree with the choice.`` I'm aware of the president's, um, predicament, but I can't say Judge Dredd would not have been my first choice.'' When asked to elaborate further, the Florida governor refused comment. \n\nBernie Sanders, meanwhile, has backed the president's push to replace Scalia. ``I think Joseph Dredd is what this country needs. ''Political analysts agree that Dredd's nomination, and non-partisan MO, may benefit the junior Senator from Vermont, if elected President. \n\nOne candidate openly critical of the nomination has been Donald Trump.`` Nobody has even heard of this guy,'' said Trump to a room of reporters. ``I know a ton of people, people who could do the job a million times better than this guy. 'Judge Dredd ', is that what they call him? I know Judge Judy. I know lots of judges. He's not as good as half of those other judges I know, ''the candidate remarked,`` who is this guy?'' \n\nJudge Dredd, who has since announced that he will retain the title of Judge, has supplanted Chief Justice John G. Roberts, as well as the remaining seven justices. In addition, the new Supreme Court of Justice has released a statement responding to Trump, which simply reads, ``I am the Law.

According to this theory, those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth, thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth. Over time, wealth condensation can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society. Thomas Piketty in his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital (r) than economic growth (g), and that larger fortunes generate higher returns [pp. 384 Table 12.2, U.S. university endowment size vs. real annual rate of return]\n\nQuestion: What has the highest impact on wealth accumulation and the resulting income inequality?", "answer": "greater return of capital"}

{"question": "The network has the unusual distinction of having separately owned and operated affiliates which serve the same market in Tampa, Florida (WFTS-TV and WWSB) and Grand Rapids, Michigan (WZZM and WOTV), with an analogous situation arising in Kansas City, Missouri (KMBC-TV and KQTV). KQTV is licensed to St. Joseph, Missouri, which is designated by Nielsen as a separate market from Kansas City despite being located within 55 miles (89 km) of one another, while WWSB and WOTV serve areas that do not receive an adequate signal from their market's primary ABC affiliate (in the case of WWSB, this dates back to when WTSP was Tampa's primary ABC affiliate prior to 1994, with the former being necessitated to serve the southern part of the Tampa market including the station's city of license, Sarasota, due to WTSP's transmitter being short-spaced to avoid interfering with the analog signal of Miami affiliate WPLG – which like WTSP, broadcast on VHF channel 10).\n\nQuestion: What are the two ABC affiliates for Kansas City, Missouri?", "answer": "KMBC-TV and KQTV"}
{"question": "As a musical style built around funk or syncopated rock and roll breaks, James Brown, Al Green, Marvin Gaye, Ella Fitzgerald, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, the Supremes, the Commodores, Jerry Lee Lewis and even Michael Jackson, are funky influences on the music. Jazz pioneer Miles Davis has been named as a possible influence. Blues artists like Lead Belly, Robert Johnson, Charlie Patton, Muddy Waters and B.B King have also been cited by producers as inspirations. Even modern avant-garde composers such as Henryk Gorecki have received mention. One of the most influential tracks in drum and bass history was \"Amen Brother\" by The Winstons which contains a drum solo that has since become known as the \"Amen break\", which after being extensively used in early hip hop music, went on to become the basis for the rhythms used in drum and bass.\n\n\nQuestion: Who is the jazz pioneer named as a possible influence?", "answer": "Miles Davis"}
{"question": "Fermentation—of grains to produce beer, and of fruits to produce wine—is an ancient art that humans in most cultures have practiced for millennia. Wild yeasts are acquired from the environment and used to ferment sugars into CO2 and ethyl alcohol under anaerobic conditions. It is now possible to purchase isolated strains of wild yeasts from different wine-making regions. Louis Pasteur was instrumental in developing a reliable strain of brewer’s yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for the French brewing industry in the late 1850s. This was one of the first examples of biotechnology patenting. Many secondary metabolites of fungi are of great commercial importance. Antibiotics are naturally produced by fungi to kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria, limiting their competition in the natural environment. Important antibiotics, such as penicillin and the cephalosporins, are isolated from fungi. Valuable drugs isolated from fungi include the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine (which reduces the risk of rejection after organ transplant), the precursors of steroid hormones, and ergot alkaloids used to stop bleeding. Psilocybin is a compound found in fungi such as Psilocybe semilanceata and Gymnopilus junonius, which have been used for their hallucinogenic properties by various cultures for thousands of years. As simple eukaryotic organisms, fungi are important model research organisms. Many advances in modern genetics were achieved by the use of the red bread mold Neurospora crassa. Additionally, many important genes originally discovered in S. cerevisiae served as a starting point in discovering analogous human genes. As a eukaryotic organism, the yeast cell produces and modifies proteins in a manner similar to human cells, as opposed to the bacterium Escherichia coli, which lacks the internal membrane structures and enzymes to tag proteins for export. This makes yeast a much better organism for use in recombinant DNA technology experiments. Like bacteria, yeasts grow easily in culture, have a short generation time, and are amenable to genetic modification.\n\nQuestion: What is an example of one?", "answer": "penicillin"}
{"question": "The Pequot War marked the first major clash between European settlers and Native Americans in New England. With the Pequot people reacting with increasing aggression to European settlers encroaching on their territory, settlers responded in 1636 with a raid on a Pequot village on Block Island. The Pequots laid siege to Saybrook Colony's garrison that autumn, then in the spring of 1637 raided Wethersfield. Colonists there declared war on the Pequots, organized a band of militia and Native Americans, and attacked a Pequot village on the Mystic River, with death toll estimates ranging between 300 and 700 Pequots. After suffering another major loss at a battle in Fairfield, the Pequots asked for a truce and peace terms.\n\n\nQuestion: Where did the colonist first attack the Pequots after declaring war?", "answer": "Pequot village on the Mystic River"}
{"question": "In 1967, the National Hockey League doubled in size to 12 teams, undertaking one of the greatest expansions in professional sports history. A few years later, in 1972, a new 12 team league, the World Hockey Association (WHA) was formed and due to its ensuing rivalry with the NHL, it caused an escalation in players salaries. As of 1979, the NHL had grown to 17 teams and merged with the WHA. This created a 21 team league.

{"question": "From seeing reactions to the documentary it seems people don't understand how important trustworthiness is to the legal system. Without trust, investigators/police have little merit over the average person on the street. An investigator who has proven him/herself untrustworthy is worse than the average person on the street. Yet it seems despite certain investigators in the Avery case betraying the public trust well before the murder trial started, people are still seeing them as credible authority figures (and of course they were praised as such during the trial). Even people who side with the accused. Investigators have some advanced techniques and resources at their disposal that the average citizen does not, but again, their biggest strength is being trustworthy... which is why they are allowed control over crime scenes, evidence safekeeping, etc. None of those tools matter if the sanctity of the legal system isn't preserved. I think the public at large really needs to better understand the importance of trust (or lack thereof) for the justice system to substantially improve.\n\nQuestion: Who was betrayed by the investigators in the Avery case?", "answer": "investigators in the Avery case betraying the public trust well before the murder trial started"}

{"question": "All these 4 1/2 inch patty makers are too small for a decent sized burger. At 4.5 inches diameter, using ground beef that is 15% fat, the cooked burger will shrink down to about 3 inch diameter, which is too small for an adult-sized burger, and looks silly in an average sized bun. When you buy the pre-formed 1/4 lb patties in the supermarket, that come in the poly-sleeve, they are 5 inches in diameter. That is a good minimum diameter to start with. 5 1/2 inches would be much better, which would cook down to about 4 inches, which looks good on a bun. But try to find a 5 1/2 inch burger press, or even a 5 inch burger press. There aren't any. Just these useless 4.5 inch burger presses. I have 2 different styles, and whether one produces ripples, or the other produces a center dimple, has NO effect on reducing the shrinkage of the cooked patty. I am thinking that using a rolling pin on some ground beef, on a silicone mat,or waxed paper, to get the desired thickness of patty, and cutting out 5.5 inch pattys with a heavy duty 5.5 inch cookie cutter, is the only way to go.

{"question": "The Balkans, or the Balkan Peninsula, is a geographic area in Eastern and Southeastern Europe with various and disputed borders. The region takes its name from the Balkan Mountains that stretch from the Serbian-Bulgarian border to the Black Sea. \n\nThe Balkan Peninsula is bordered by the Adriatic Sea on the northwest, the Ionian Sea on the southwest, the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea on the south and southeast, and the Black Sea on the east and northeast. The northern border of the peninsula is variously defined. The highest point of the Balkans is Mount Musala in the Rila mountain range. \n\nThe word \"Balkan\" comes from Ottoman Turkish \"\" 'a chain of wooded mountains\"; related words are also found in other Turkic languages. The origin of the Turkic word is obscure; it may be related to Persian \"bālk\" meaning \"mud\", and the Turkish suffix \"an\", i.e., \"swampy forest\" or Persian \"balā-khāna\" 'big high house'. \n\nFrom classical antiquity through the Middle Ages, the Balkan Mountains were called by the local Thracian name \"Haemus\". According to Greek mythology, the Thracian king Haemus was turned into a mountain by Zeus as a punishment and the mountain has remained with his name. A reverse name scheme has also been suggested. D. Dechev considers that Haemus (Αἷμος) is derived from a Thracian word \"*saimon\", 'mountain ridge'. A third possibility is that \"Haemus\" () derives from the Greek word \"haema\" () meaning 'blood'. The myth relates to a fight between Zeus and the monster/titan Typhon. Zeus injured Typhon with a thunder bolt and Typhon's blood fell on the mountains, from which they got their name.\n\nQuestion: What does Balkan mean?", "answer": "'a chain of wooded mountains"}

{"question": "Before the second wave there were some important events which laid the groundwork for it. French writer Simone de Beauvoir had in the 1940s examined the notion of women being perceived as \"other\" in the patriarchal society. She went on to conclude that male-centered ideology was being accepted as a norm and enforced by the ongoing development of myths, and that the fact that women are capable of getting pregnant, lactating, and menstruating is in no way a valid cause or explanation to place them as the \"second sex\".\nThis book was translated from French to English (with some of its text excised) and published in America in 1953. In 1960 the Food and Drug Administration approved the combined oral contraceptive pill, which was made available in 1961. This made it easier for women to have careers without having to leave due to unexpectedly becoming pregnant. The administration of President Kennedy made women's rights a key issue of the New Frontier, and named women (such as Esther Peterson) to many high-ranking posts in his administration. Kennedy also established a Presidential Commission on the Status of Women, chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt and comprising cabinet officials (including Peterson and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy), senators, representatives, businesspeople, psychologists, sociologists, professors, activists, and public servants. There were also notable actions by women in wider society, presaging their wider engagement in politics which would come with the second wave.

{"question": "It is likely that a multicomponent, adaptive immune system arose with the first vertebrates, as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response. Many species, however, utilize mechanisms that appear to be precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity. Immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life, with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism, called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages. Prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity, through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. Offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes, but studies of their roles in defense are few.\n\nQuestion: What is the system by which prokaryotes retain phage gene fragments that they have previously come in contact with?", "answer": "CRISPR"}

{"question": "Beneficial Fungi Fungi play a crucial role in the balance of ecosystems. They colonize most habitats on Earth, preferring dark, moist conditions. They can thrive in seemingly hostile environments, such as the tundra, thanks to a most successful symbiosis with photosynthetic organisms, like lichens. Fungi are not obvious in the way that large animals or tall trees are. Yet, like bacteria, they are major decomposers of nature. With their versatile metabolism, fungi break down organic matter that is insoluble and would not be recycled otherwise. Importance to Ecosystems Food webs would be incomplete without organisms that decompose organic matter and fungi are key participants in this process. Decomposition allows for cycling of nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus back into the environment so they are available to living things, rather than being trapped in dead organisms. Fungi are particularly important because they have evolved enzymes to break down cellulose and lignin, components of plant cell walls that few other organisms are able to digest, releasing their carbon content. Fungi are also involved in ecologically important coevolved symbioses, both mutually beneficial and pathogenic with organisms from the other kingdoms. Mycorrhiza, a term combining the Greek roots myco meaning fungus and rhizo.\n\nQuestion: Where do fungi grow on this planet?", "answer": "most habitats"}

{"question": "While constitutional law concerns the European Union's governance structure, administrative law binds EU institutions and member states to follow the law. Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or \"standing\" (locus standi) to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties. From the EU's foundation, the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations, if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations. However, under Directives, citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties. This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation. These rules on \"direct effect\" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law. All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged. The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages, but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction, in order to ensure the law is effective as possible.\n\nQuestion: Which type of law concerns the EU's governance structure?", "answer": "constitutional law"}
{"question": "Exactly as described, except... that I expected to assemble it. It came assembled. I have a 50\" plasma TV that weighs about 60 pounds on it and it holds it perfectly.I noticed that one of the reviews mentioned the underside of the top was unfinished. The one I received IS finished on the underside of the top. I moved the little rubber feet from the ends of the legs to 3\" in from the edge, which allowed me to hang the stand 2.5\" off the back of my credenza to make room to place a dialog speaker in front of the stand.It's a pretty basic item, but it is unobtrusive and strong.Can't say much more other than to repeat it is exactly what I expected and fits my purpose perfectly.\n\nQuestion: What was mentioned in one of the reviews?", "answer": "the underside of the top was unfinished"}
{"question": "Today, Manhattan is the only borough in New York City that does not have a professional baseball franchise. The Bronx has the Yankees (American League) and Queens has the Mets (National League) of Major League Baseball. The Minor League Baseball Brooklyn Cyclones play in Brooklyn, while the Staten Island Yankees play in Staten Island. Yet three of the four major league teams to play in New York City played in Manhattan. The New York Giants played in the various incarnations of the Polo Grounds at 155th Street and Eighth Avenue from their inception in 1883—except for 1889, when they split their time between Jersey City and Staten Island, and when they played in Hilltop Park in 1911—until they headed west with the Brooklyn Dodgers after the 1957 season. The New York Yankees began their franchise as the Highlanders, named for Hilltop Park, where they played from their creation in 1903 until 1912. The team moved to the Polo Grounds with the 1913 season, where they were officially christened the New York Yankees, remaining there until they moved across the Harlem River in 1923 to Yankee Stadium. The New York Mets played in the Polo Grounds in 1962 and 1963, their first two seasons, before Shea Stadium was completed in 1964. After the Mets departed, the Polo Grounds was demolished in April 1964, replaced by public housing.\n\n\nQuestion: When was Shea stadium completed?", "answer": "1964"}
{"question": "Great product! I have to say this lunch warmer heats food quite evenly, much better than a microwave. My husband and I keep stash of healthy leftovers in 2 cup round glass containers in the freezer to grab and go. These work beautifully with the lunch warmer. The night before, I choose lunch for the next day, put it in the frig to partially thaw and my lunch is ready to slide into the crock pot warmer once I get to work the next morning. No spills on the way to work as it is partially frozen, and the 2 cup amount is below the max fill line on the metal insert. I must say I am looking forward to our next road trip as I plan taking 2 crock pots, a cooler and an inverter to help minimize the monetary and weight gain expense of travel. I've read complaints about the cord length (3 ft), but any longer would make it awkward to wind and carry. Liked this product so much, I bought 7 of them as gifts, all greatly appreciated....even got a lunch text photo from my son, the engineer and a big thank you from my Marine!

{"question": "Lions get very lonely sometimes but they have a difficult time trying to make friends. Lions have big teeth, sharp claws, and sometimes, they are very cranky. They don't always get along with other animals or humans, so they have to get rid of their anger and their crazy emotions to make and keep friends. Zebras and lions like to play tag, but sometimes it gets a little rough and zebra gets hurt. When that happens, a nice lion needs to say sorry and to try to find another friend. A lion might go up to a chicken and smile, or maybe a lion might bring a horse some flowers or food to make him or her less nervous. It's not easy to be friends with a lion, but a friendship takes time and a lot of hard work and that's what is most important! Also, my auntie always told me to be strong like a lion but to always be nice. Having big teeth, sharp claws, and being cranky is not good, and we need to work hard to be the opposite of that to make sure we keep our friends.\n\nQuestion: Is being cranky a good thing?", "answer": "no"}

{"question": "There are two types of thylakoids—granal thylakoids, which are arranged in grana, and stromal thylakoids, which are in contact with the stroma. Granal thylakoids are pancake-shaped circular disks about 300–600 nanometers in diameter. Stromal thylakoids are helicoid sheets that spiral around grana. The flat tops and bottoms of granal thylakoids contain only the relatively flat photosystem II protein complex. This allows them to stack tightly, forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane, called granal membrane, increasing stability and surface area for light capture.\n\nQuestion: What shape are granal thylakoids?", "answer": "pancake-shaped circular disks"}
{"question": "[Achievement]600 Days! Box tour and stuff~. 600 days: LINKREMOVED Box: LINKREMOVED Quick summary of my PAD journey thus far: I started with a group of my friends, most of whom still play today with the tag @ST. My first roll was Haku, but my first main (and hyper) was Ronia. I played the game on and off for about six months, sometimes forgetting to even log in to claim my bonus - I missed around 7 to 8 days of login bonuses, so I should technically be at ~610 days today. Thanks to 10x descends, I was able to reach 200 hypered cards by my 600th day, which is why there's a huge discrepancy in time and stones between the first link and second. I think it's fairly obvious from the photos that I IAP quite heavily and play too much on a daily basis. If you have any questions or stuff you want to know about me, feel free to ask (though I'm not going to answer questions about how much I've spent, things along those lines). Lastly, I'd like to give a big shout out to the friends who started this game with me, as well as the amazing people I have met while playing. You should know who you are, but I want to especially thank /u/Cmpukahi and /u/eckido.

{"question": "After spending what seemed like a ridiculous amount of time and being doused with red juice while pitting cherries to make a cherry sauce (for pork tenderloin..yummy combo, if you've never tried it), I was seeking the perfect cherry pitting device. Thank goodness for Amazon and it's reviewers, because I probably would never have purchased something that seems so 'gimmicky' by appearance. But I took the positive reviewers at their words and wasn't at all disappointed...this works great! I had the larger cherries and placed them face-down with the stems removed (but works either way), and not a single pit was left in the cherries. I would have been happy with a 90% success rate but ended up with 100% and a speedy processing time...and no mess to speak of. If it doesn't work well for you, maybe you're not using it properly? Because I found it to be perfect. I'd pay even more for it now that I've seen how well it works.\n\nQuestion: Did the product have good reviews?", "answer": "the positive reviewers"}
{"question": "It is rare that I give 5 star reviews, but this grill is a really fun little gadget. We have been using it regularly for several months and the non-stick surface shows no signs of wear.We have used it to grill foods on the dining room table itself and our guests were wowed. We have the black one and it looks very stylish on the table. It is suitable for casual to semi-formal meals. At a big family breakfast, we set it up next to the stove and used it to cook a whole package of bacon at once (smooth side of grill) and thanks to the smart design, all the grease drains away (into the drain pan below) making it so easy to transition to the eggs and pancakes without dirtying a whole cupboard of frying pans. The large cooking surface heats evenly and accurately. It expands the usable cooking area beyond our stove and has been a big time-saver when cooking for a large number of people.My only gripe (and it is a minor gripe) is that the unit is not dishwasher safe and is a bit tedious to clean. Because grease and food splatters beyond the cooking surface, the whole thing requires cleaning after use. There is a handy scraper tool included to help clean both sides of the grill surface, but additional scrubbing with a brush and sponge is still required. It usually takes about ten minutes to clean and dry the whole thing.All in all, I have loved this grill and would recommend!\n\nQuestion: What type of surface does the grill have?", "answer": "non-stick"}
{"question": "How do I create a list of all lists of n integers, each between 0 and 4? I've got a problem involving n different variables, where n is some integer between 1 and 18, each of which is between 0 and 4. I've also got a somewhat complicated function to check whether a list of n integers actually represents a valid configuration. Finally, I've got a function which checks if one configuration can be reached from another in one move. The problem is to, given an initial configuration, find the shortest sequence of moves which ends in a configuration satisfying a certain constraint. (Which I've also got an easy way to check for.) My idea for solving this problem is to take a list of all such lists of integers, use Select to pick out the ones that are valid positions, use RelationGraph to generate a graph with nodes as configurations and edges as moves, and then apply some graph theory stuff to find the desired shortest path. Unfortunately, since I'm very much a beginner at using Mathematica, I can't actually figure out how to generate that list. The other steps are simple, but that one seems to require some trick instead of just a stock function. Anyone know the trick, or able to offer up a smarter approach to the problem?\n\nQuestion: what is the goal of the problem they are solving?", "answer": "find the shortest sequence of moves which ends in a configuration satisfying a certain constraint"}

{"question": "The earliest rocks in the Sierra Nevada are metamorphic roof pendants of Paleozoic age, the oldest rocks being metasedimentary rocks from the Cambrian in the Mount Morrison region. They are dark colored hornfels, slates, marbles, and schists, and are found in the western foothills (notably around Coarsegold and west of the Tehachapi Pass) and also east of the Sierra Crest. The earliest granite of the Sierra started to form in the Triassic period. This granite is mostly found east of the crest and north of 37.2°N. In the Triassic and into the Jurassic, an island arc collided with the west coast of North America and raised a chain of volcanoes, in an event called the Nevadan orogeny. Nearly all subaerial Sierran Arc volcanoes have since disappeared; their remains were redeposited during the Great Valley Sequence and the subsequent Cenozoic filling of the Great Valley, which is the source of much of the sedimentary rock in California.\n\n\nQuestion: What was the name of the collision that raised a chain of volcanoes?", "answer": "the Nevadan orogeny"}
{"question": "In World War II, it was recognised that the Rhine would present a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of Germany, by the Western Allies. The Rhine bridge at Arnhem, immortalized in the book, A Bridge Too Far and the film, was a central focus of the battle for Arnhem, during the failed Operation Market Garden of September 1944. The bridges at Nijmegen, over the Waal distributary of the Rhine, were also an objective of Operation Market Garden. In a separate operation, the Ludendorff Bridge, crossing the Rhine at Remagen, became famous, when U.S. forces were able to capture it intact – much to their own surprise – after the Germans failed to demolish it. This also became the subject of a film, The Bridge at Remagen. Seven Days to the River Rhine was a Warsaw Pact war plan for an invasion of Western Europe during the Cold War.\n\nQuestion: When was Operation Market Garden?", "answer": "September 1944"}
